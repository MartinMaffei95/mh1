              <p class="indented">
                The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
                to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <h3>DIMENSIONS.</h3>
                  IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                  within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                  dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                  under 12 and older.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>COMPETITION FIELDS.</h3>
                  Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum
                  of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations
                  participating in the state competition program that are unable
                  to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must
                  advise the State Competition Board which will assign its
                  Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                  Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
                  be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that
                  are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to
                  play all their games away.

                      progressively larger.

                    <li>
                      In addition, fields used by young age groups may have
